# DownTimeWP

DownTimeWP is a simple WordPress plugin that allows you to put your website into maintenance mode. When activated, users will see a "Under Maintenance" page, while administrators can still access the website for updates and maintenance tasks. This plugin is ideal for developers or site owners who need to temporarily take their site offline for updates or maintenance.

## Features

- **Enable/Disable Maintenance Mode**: Easily toggle maintenance mode from the WordPress admin panel.
- **Maintenance Page**: A beautifully designed maintenance page to inform visitors of the downtime.
- **Admin Access**: Only administrators will be able to access the website while maintenance mode is enabled.
- **Simple Setup**: Easily configurable with just a few clicks from the settings page.

## Installation

1. Download the plugin ZIP file.
2. Go to your WordPress admin dashboard.
3. Navigate to **Plugins > Add New**.
4. Click **Upload Plugin** and select the downloaded ZIP file.
5. Click **Install Now**, and then **Activate**.

Alternatively, you can manually upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.

## Usage

Once the plugin is installed and activated:

1. Go to **Settings > DownTimeWP** in your WordPress admin panel.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can I customize the maintenance page?

Currently, the plugin uses a default maintenance page. You can modify the page's HTML and CSS by editing the `maintenance.php` file inside the plugin directory.

### Can I still access my site while the plugin is active?

Yes, only administrators (those with the `manage_options` capability) can access the site when maintenance mode is enabled. All other visitors will see the maintenance page.

### How can I change the maintenance page content?

The content of the maintenance page is located in the `maintenance.php` file within the plugin directory. You can edit the content and style to suit your needs.
